Kenyans are settling into a culture of digital transactions Total mobile money transfers grew by a whopping 20% in 2020 which is one of the largest increments recorded in the last 5 years.

This was followed by administrative and support service activities, transportation and storage and education at 25.0, 21.5 and 20.8 per cent, respectively.

Total secondary enrolment decreased from 3.5 million in March 2020 to 3.3 million in March 2021 when the schools fully reopened.
